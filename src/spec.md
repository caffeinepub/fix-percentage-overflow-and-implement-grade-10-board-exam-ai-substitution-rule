# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix marks display format, add filtering capabilities, and correct grade calculation logic in the academic tracking system.

**Planned changes:**
- Display raw marks as actual numbers (e.g., 73) instead of percentages throughout the application
- Enable filtering of grades by both section and term in grades view
- Fix 9-scale grading system calculation to work properly
- Calculate letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) based on percentage thresholds rather than grading system numbers

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see correct numerical marks instead of percentages, can filter grades by section and term, and view accurate 9-scale and letter grade calculations based on proper percentage thresholds.
