# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix grading thresholds to use 10-point intervals and update subject-subgroup availability rules.

**Planned changes:**
- Update grading system to use 10-point intervals: 90-100 = A+, 80-89 = A, 70-79 = B+, 60-69 = B, 50-59 = C+, 40-49 = C, continuing the pattern below 40
- Configure PE (Physical Education) as an elective subject available for all subgroups across all grades
- Restrict Mathematics subject to Commerce subgroup only, removing it from Science and Humanities subgroups

**User-visible outcome:** Letter grades will display correctly using the new 10-point threshold system, PE will be available as an elective for all students regardless of subgroup, and Mathematics will only appear as an option for Commerce students.
