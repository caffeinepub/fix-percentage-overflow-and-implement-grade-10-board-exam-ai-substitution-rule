# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add raw-marks percentage table and frequency-polygon chart to the Academic Module for visualizing grade performance across terms.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new table component displaying raw-marks percentage for grades 9-12 across Term 1 and Term 2
- Create a frequency-polygon chart visualizing combined percentage distribution from both terms
- Integrate both new components into the AcademicModule as new tabs or sections in the Progress View

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view a sortable table showing raw-marks percentages for each grade and term, and visualize the overall percentage distribution through a frequency-polygon chart with connected line segments showing performance trends.
