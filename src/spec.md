# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance Subject Analysis view with average percentages and correct Mathematics subject classification for Commerce streams.

**Planned changes:**
- Add average percentage display alongside average raw marks in Subject Analysis table
- Move Mathematics from compulsory to elective subjects for Commerce subgroups (CEBA and CEBA-CS)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view both average marks and percentages per subject in the analysis view, and Mathematics will correctly appear as an elective option when entering marks for Commerce students.
